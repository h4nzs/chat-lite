# Fixes Summary

## Issue 1: Messages not loading properly on refresh
- **Problem**: `openConversation` function in `chat.ts` calls `loadMessages`, but UI ChatWindow not waiting or subscribing to state changes properly.
- **Solution**: Added proper useEffect in ChatWindow to handle active conversation, and ensured that the activeId is properly set when visiting a conversation.

## Issue 2: Form input/file/send button not appearing
- **Problem**: In `ChatWindow.tsx`, the `<MessageInput>` was conditionally rendered based on `activeConversation`, but sometimes `activeId` was not set properly.
- **Solution**: Made sure the input section in ChatWindow renders unconditionally when activeId exists, and fixed the activeId state management.

## Issue 3: Indicator "is typing" and online dot not working
- **Problem**: Socket event `typing` and `presence:update` not properly bound in `chat.ts`.
- **Solution**: Added typing indicator functionality with proper socket events emission and listener setup:
  - Added typing event handling in ChatWindow component
  - Updated socket.ts to handle typing and presence events
  - Fixed presence update mechanism in socket connection

## Issue 4: Add group button not showing modal
- **Problem**: In `Sidebar.tsx`, the `GroupModal` was conditionally rendered, not always mounted in DOM.
- **Solution**: Created a complete `CreateGroupChat.tsx` component that is properly structured as a modal and handles group creation.

## Additional Backend Issues Addressed:

### JWT Refresh Token
- Confirmed that refresh token functionality was already implemented in `/api/auth/refresh` endpoint.

### Error Handling
- Improved error handling in routes (already well-implemented with try/catch blocks).

### Socket Authentication
- Verified that socket authentication middleware was already properly implemented.

## Additional Frontend Issues Addressed:

### Zustand Stores Improvements
- Added `replaceMessageTemp` method to chat store for better optimistic updates management.

### Socket Lifecycle Management
- Improved socket connection and disconnection handling.

### UI/UX Improvements
- Fixed typing indicator integration
- Improved group modal functionality
- Better error handling for message sending and file uploads

### Routing 
- Ensured proper loading of conversation when accessing `/chat/:id` directly via URL.
