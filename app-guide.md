# Chat-Lite Application Issues Report

## Critical Issues

### 1. Environment Variable Configuration Issues
**Problem:** Environment variables are not loading correctly, causing port conflicts and incorrect URLs.
- Server tries to use port 4000 even when PORT=4002 is set in .env
- Frontend still connects to localhost:4000 despite VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4002
- Multiple .env files with conflicting configurations

**Impact:** Application fails to start or connect properly due to port conflicts and incorrect URLs.

**Solution:** 
- Ensure dotenv is loaded before any other imports
- Remove duplicate/conflicting .env files
- Use consistent port configuration across all files
- Restart development servers after configuration changes

### 2. WebSocket Connection Issues
**Problem:** WebSocket connections fail with "Firefox can't establish a connection to the server" errors.
- CORS configuration mismatch between frontend and backend
- Port configuration mismatch (frontend tries port 4000, server runs on 4002)
- Socket.IO authentication token not properly transmitted

**Impact:** Real-time chat functionality is broken.

**Solution:**
- Ensure CLIENT_URL in server .env matches frontend URL
- Verify VITE_WS_URL points to correct server port
- Check Socket.IO CORS configuration in server code

### 3. Port Conflict Issues
**Problem:** EADDRINUSE errors when starting the server.
- Previous server instances not properly terminated
- Multiple processes trying to use the same port

**Impact:** Server fails to start.

**Solution:**
- Kill all Node.js processes before starting servers
- Use different ports for development instances
- Implement proper process cleanup

## High Priority Issues

### 4. Authentication Token Storage Issues
**Problem:** Auth tokens are not properly stored/managed in the frontend.
- Login component doesn't store tokens in cookies/localStorage
- Auth store doesn't handle token refresh properly

**Impact:** Users get logged out frequently or can't authenticate.

**Solution:**
- Implement proper token storage in auth store
- Add token refresh mechanism
- Ensure secure cookie settings

### 5. CORS Configuration Issues
**Problem:** Cross-Origin Request Blocked errors due to incorrect CORS setup.
- Server CORS origin doesn't match frontend URL
- Credentials not properly configured

**Impact:** API requests fail.

**Solution:**
- Correct CORS_ORIGIN in server .env
- Ensure withCredentials is set in frontend requests
- Verify server CORS middleware configuration

## Medium Priority Issues

### 6. Form Validation Issues
**Problem:** Basic form validation is implemented but could be more robust.
- Client-side validation only
- No server-side validation for forms

**Impact:** Potential for invalid data submission.

**Solution:**
- Add comprehensive server-side validation
- Implement stronger client-side validation
- Add user-friendly error messages

### 7. Error Handling Issues
**Problem:** Error handling is inconsistent across the application.
- Some API errors are not properly caught/displayed
- WebSocket connection errors don't provide user feedback

**Impact:** Poor user experience when errors occur.

**Solution:**
- Implement consistent error handling patterns
- Add user-friendly error messages
- Provide feedback for connection issues

## Low Priority Issues

### 8. TypeScript Path Alias Issues
**Problem:** Some import paths use relative paths instead of aliases.
- Inconsistent use of @components, @store, etc. aliases
- Potential for import resolution issues

**Impact:** Code maintainability issues.

**Solution:**
- Standardize on path aliases
- Update tsconfig.json with proper alias mappings
- Refactor imports to use aliases consistently

### 9. Security Issues
**Problem:** Some security practices could be improved.
- JWT secret has default value in development
- Cookie security settings could be more restrictive

**Impact:** Potential security vulnerabilities.

**Solution:**
- Require JWT_SECRET in production
- Implement stricter cookie security settings
- Add input sanitization/validation

### 10. Performance Issues
**Problem:** Some performance optimizations are missing.
- No caching for static assets
- Potential for memory leaks in WebSocket connections

**Impact:** Suboptimal performance.

**Solution:**
- Implement proper caching headers
- Add WebSocket connection cleanup
- Optimize database queries

## Recent Fixes Implemented

### 11. Prisma Client Singleton Issue
**Status:** Fixed
- Implemented singleton pattern for Prisma client to prevent connection issues

### 12. Input Sanitization
**Status:** Fixed
- Added XSS protection for message content in Socket.IO events

### 13. Form Validation
**Status:** Fixed
- Added validation to login and register forms

## Recommendations

1. **Environment Management:**
   - Use a single source of truth for environment variables
   - Implement environment validation at startup
   - Document environment variable requirements

2. **Development Workflow:**
   - Create scripts to properly start/stop development servers
   - Implement process monitoring to detect port conflicts
   - Add health checks for services

3. **Error Monitoring:**
   - Implement centralized error logging
   - Add user-friendly error pages
   - Monitor WebSocket connection status

4. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints
   - Add CSRF protection
   - Encrypt sensitive data in database

5. **Testing:**
   - Add unit tests for authentication flows
   - Implement integration tests for WebSocket functionality
   - Add end-to-end tests for critical user journeys
