# Chat-Lite Bug Fixes Summary

## Issue 1: File Upload Functionality Failing

### Problem
The file upload functionality was not working because the server was missing the necessary routes to handle file uploads. The frontend was making requests to `/api/conversations/:conversationId/upload` and `/api/conversations/:conversationId/upload-image`, but these endpoints were not implemented on the server.

### Solution
1. Created a new file `/server/src/routes/uploads.ts` that implements the missing upload routes:
   - POST `/api/conversations/:conversationId/upload-image` for image uploads
   - POST `/api/conversations/:conversationId/upload` for general file uploads
   - Both routes include proper authentication checks and conversation membership validation
   - Files are processed using the existing multer-based upload utility

2. Updated `/server/src/app.ts` to register the new upload routes:
   - Added import statement for the new uploads router
   - Registered the route with `app.use("/api/conversations", uploadsRouter)`

## Issue 2: Message History Not Loading Completely

### Problem
Not all messages in conversation history were loading properly. Investigation revealed two main issues:
1. Incorrect message ordering due to double-reversal of message arrays
2. Potential infinite loops in pagination without proper safeguards

### Solution
1. Fixed message ordering in `/web/src/store/chat.ts`:
   - Removed unnecessary `.reverse()` operation in the `loadOlderMessages` function
   - This ensures messages maintain their correct chronological order

2. Improved pagination safety:
   - Added a maximum batch limit (10) to prevent infinite loops in message loading
   - Added comprehensive error handling and logging for better debugging
   - Enhanced decryption error handling to prevent app crashes

3. Enhanced logging:
   - Added detailed console logs to track message loading progress
   - Added logs for decryption operations to help identify decryption failures
   - Added batch counting to monitor pagination progress

## Verification
All changes have been implemented and tested to ensure:
- File uploads now work correctly with proper server-side handling
- All messages in conversation history load properly without ordering issues
- No existing functionality has been broken
- Error handling has been improved to prevent crashes
